## Assignment 3: Open vs. Closed Innovation
*Benjamin Snow and Oliver Bott*

### Background

This is the repository for the 'Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis' course taught by <a href="@christophergandrud/">https://github.com/christophergandrud</a> at the Hertie School of Governance.  This is the repository for Assignment 3, which focuses on the data gathering, cleaning, and early analyses for a final research project.  

The assignment calls for: gathering web-based data from at least two sources, as well as cleaning and merging said data.  Additionally basic descriptive and inferential statistics should be performed towards the motive of answering the previous assignments research question. Lastly a description of results with accompanying tables and figures should be included.

The proposal can be found in the Assignment3.Rmd file and is structured as follows:

1. Background 
2. Data Gathering
3. Data Sources
4. Data Selection
5. Descriptive Statistics
6. Inferential Statistics
7. Outlook
8. References

The proposal includes dynamically linked academic references (see Main.bib) and citations for R packages (see Packages.bib).

#### Assignment File
The project proposal can be found in Assignment.Rmd.  

#### Other Repository Files
- Data_Gathering.R file contains the code for the gathering and cleaning of the two data sources and is dynamically linked to the Assignment3.Rmd file.
- Dataset.csv contains the merged .csv dataset for the project which is dynamically linked to the Assignment.Rmd file. Due to the length of time gathering data using the Github API takes, this was deemed more efficient and easier than repeated pulling in of data.
- License is a basic MIT license for the project.
- Main.bib is the main bibliographic file which is dynamically linked to Assignment3.Rmd.
- Packages.bib is a bibliographic file dynamically linked to Proposal.Rmd with citations for R and R packages.
- README.MD is the file for the file currently being read, which offers introduction and context to the project, as interestingly as possible.
